# Hello, I'm Jaimin Chainani! ðŸ‘‹

## A Journey from Business to Data Enthusiasm

My story is one of transformation, a journey that led me from the world of business to the captivating realm of data analytics and visualization. I'm based in Birmingham, UK, and I'm passionate about turning data into meaningful insights.

### From Business to Analytics

I began my professional journey in the business world, armed with a degree in Electrical Engineering and a PGPM in Marketing and Operations. I ventured into roles that involved sales and business development, where I learned the importance of data in decision-making. It was during this time that I started to develop a keen interest in the analytical aspects of business operations.

### A Leap Towards Mastery

Driven by my newfound passion for data, I took a significant step and pursued a Master's in Business Analytics at Aston University, UK. It was here that I honed my skills in data engineering, programming (Python, SQL, R), and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. This academic journey not only deepened my knowledge but also ignited a desire to contribute to data-driven decision-making.

### The Power of Visualization

Currently, I'm immersed in the fascinating world of data visualization, with a focus on mastering Power BI. To gain practical experience and enhance my skills, I'm actively working on end-to-end projects.
